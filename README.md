### A little about the gameplay
 * The borders do not kill the snake, but teleport to the other side of the map
 * 10 points for each apple
 * Use the English keyboard layout to control
 * Don't resize the window during gameplay if you don't want to break the renderer
 * You have to enjoy the game

Enjoy! ;)
